                Liberian refugee Elisha founded Envision Health Access
                Initiative. He has over 10 years of global healthcare expertise
                and a background in Global Public Health and Healthcare
                Management. He is a specialist in leadership, program planning,
                execution, and assessment. Envision was inspired by Elisha's
